# Multiscale Transcriptomic Analysis of Autism Brain (GSE28521)

This project analyzes the GSE28521 dataset: postmortem brain tissue (frontal & temporal cortex, cerebellum) from individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and neurotypical controls, profiled with Illumina microarrays.

Goals:
- Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ASD and controls in frontal cortex.
- Explore enriched biological pathways (synaptic, immune, glial, etc.).
- Interpret findings in the context of cortical patterning abnormalities reported in autism.

Technologies:
- R (Bioconductor: GEOquery, limma, clusterProfiler, org.Hs.eg.db, tidyverse)
- Git & GitHub for version control

Ethics:
- Uses publicly available, de-identified gene expression data from NCBI GEO (GSE28521).
